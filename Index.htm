										I am a connector. I am passionate about teaching people. I wear many hats: developer, teacher, coach and mentor.
										My experience comes from thirty five years of practical experience. After graduating from and getting a major in English and a minor in Computer Science at BYU, I was able to work at several jobs involving teaching and training people to use complex software programs. 
										I then moved on to doing consulting for an Inc 500 company and traveled across the US and to Europe doing training and coaching. I worked mostly in one-to-many settings helping clients understand the systems developed for them.
										In addition to hone teaching skills, I helped develop and edit other educational content including written coursework.
											The following strengths & skills make me a great asset*:
							
												• Teaches with energy and passion
												• Excels in innovating creative solutions to problems & creating novel ideas
												• Engaged and "buys in" to organizational vision, working well with teams or individually
												• Proactive go-getter in seeking out additional assignments
												• Meets deadlines consistently 
												• Strong writer, visual eye, & good presenter
												• Flexible with a variety of skills & know-how to figure out new things"
